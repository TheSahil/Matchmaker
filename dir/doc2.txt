Project Narrative Cancer biology research within this institutional, multidisciplinary training program is aimed at elucidating the molecular mechanisms responsible for initiation and progression of human cancer. Translational research is also directed at improving diagnosis and therapies for this terrible disease, and our training faculty have made discoveries that have led to new cancer therapies. Both pre- and postdoctoral trainees participate in rigorous didactic as well as state-of-the-art laboratory and/or computational research training with the earliest cadre having now established academic careers in cancer research.
